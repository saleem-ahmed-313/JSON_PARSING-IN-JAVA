# JSON Manipulation in Java Example

This is a simple Java program demonstrating how to work with JSON objects using the `org.json` library. The program shows how to:

- Parse JSON strings into `JSONObject` and `JSONArray`.
- Access nested JSON objects and arrays.
- Add new fields to existing JSON objects.
- Modify JSON objects conditionally inside arrays.
- Pretty-print the JSON output.

## Features

- Parse and update address details in a JSON object.
- Iterate over an array of students, adding a `campus` field to those with the branch `"Cse"`.
- Custom recursive method to print JSON objects neatly (optional, commented in code).
- Use multi-line string literals for easy JSON input.

## How to run

1. Make sure to add the `org.json` library to your project dependencies.
2. Compile and run `App.java`.
3. Observe the updated JSON printed to the console showing added fields and updates.

## Overview

This project helps you get comfortable with JSON handling in Java, including reading, modifying, and printing JSON data structures programmatically.
